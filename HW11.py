#1. Go to the link below and convert the code into pseudocode in comments, then code the flowchart completely:

#import random library
import random
#Make temperature variable, give it a value (random from 1 to 30)
temp = random.randint(1,30)
#Make if statement that checks if temp is more than 20
#   - If more, print it's hot
#   - If less, go to next if statement

#Make if statement that checks if temp is more than 10
#   - If more, print it's mild
#   - If less, print it's cold

#Print thank you, and end the code


#Code goes here:
if temp > 20:
    print("it is hot")
elif temp > 10:
    print("it is decent")
else:
    print("it is freezing")
print("thank you")
